# TR Angular Unit Testing

This repository provides an example of unit testing an Angular component using Jasmine and Karma.

## Component: AppComponent

The `AppComponent` is a simple Angular component that displays a title, a button, and a count. Clicking the button increments the count.

### Usage

To use the `AppComponent` in your Angular application, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `AppComponent` directory (`src/app/components/my-component`) into your Angular project's corresponding directory.
2. Import the `AppComponent` in your module file (`app.module.ts` or similar) and add it to the `declarations` array.
3. Use the `<app-my-component></app-my-component>` selector in your template to include the `AppComponent` in your desired location.


### Unit Tests
The unit tests for the MyComponent component can be found in the my-component.component.spec.ts file.

### Running Tests
To run the unit tests, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Install the necessary dependencies by running npm install in the repository's root directory.

Run the command npm test or ng test to execute the tests.

The Karma test runner will launch and run the tests, providing you with the test results and coverage information.

### Test Cases
The following test cases are included:

should create the component: Verifies that the component is successfully created.

should display the correct title: Checks if the component's HTML template displays the correct title.

should increment count on button click: Tests if the button click event correctly increments the count and updates the DOM.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it as needed for your own unit testing requirements.
